## Project description

- In this project, we will explore and compare how different open-source generative AI models generate poetry based on user-provided themes and prompts. Our goal is to assess how effectively these generative models produce poems that align with the intended themes, emotions and  settings while maintaining creativity and coherence. We will ensure that the poems sound natural and adhere to poetic conventions. By evaluating each model’s performance, we aim to identify which models excel at generating poetry and highlight areas where improvements are needed.

## Project Scope
 
- We’ll be using several generative AI models to create poems based on user-provided themes or topics, including:
 
  - GPT-2
  - FLAN-T5
  - BLOOM
  - LLAMA
  - Reformer
  - BART
 
 - Example Prompt - _A person wandering through a lonely autumn evening in a quiet forest, with a melancholic tone. The person feels the weight of solitude as they walk among the falling leaves._

- The main goal is to have these models generate poems, then evaluate their quality using the following criteria:
 
  - Fluency                 : How smooth and natural the poem sounds (using metrics like Perplexity, BLEU, and METEOR).
  - Creativity              : How original and unique the poem is (using metrics like Self-BLEU, Distinct-N).
  - Adherence to the prompt : How well the poem matches the given theme or context (using metrics like Cosine Similarity, Sentiment Analysis).
  - Poetic Structure        : How well the poem follows traditional poetry rules, such as syllable count and rhyme patterns.
  
- By evaluating these aspects, we’ll determine which models are best at generating poems that match the given theme.
